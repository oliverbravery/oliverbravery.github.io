Hex Baron was a two-dimensional, single player, commandline game created by AQA in C-Sharp utilising the .NET 5 framework. Using my knowledege of the Unity game engine and 
online networking I remade the game using the C-Sharp language in Unity to make it a multiplayer, three-dimensional game. The game uses the photon (Pun) networking library 
for unity to allow the game to be multiplayer. When the game is loaded, the player is asked to either enter a game code or create a new game. Furthermore, each player must 
also enter a user name so that in game the players can differentiate between each other.
