'Coda' is a Minecraft modification created using the Java programming language. Unlike most video game companies, Mojang allows users to modify the backend code for 
Minecraft. This sparks a lot of creativity in the community and is one of the reasons i learnt the Java programming language. This project showcases my ability to understand code 
written by other developers (the game's creators) and modify that code to create something unique. Furthermore, this project shows my ability to be resourceful, researching different 
projects which solve issues i stumble upon to help come up with an inactive solution.

To inject methods into the games code, 'mixins' were used. Mixins allow methods to describe the location for where the code should be injected then, when the code is being compiled, 
the mixin's code will be integrated into the game's code. Some examples of these in my project would be the 'AutoFishMixin' class which injects code into the 'FishingBobberEntity' 
class . This means that my code is run whenever the game executes a certain method in the 'FishingBobberEntity' class (which in this case was when a fish goes for the bait, reel in 
the line).
